                    Nyeema Morgan’s meticulous drawings, sculptures, and installations deploy non-identical
                    repetition
                    and juxtaposition to prompt reflection on the mechanics of representation and its political and
                    social
                    underpinnings and consequences. A sensual conceptualist, her formal strategies trouble the
                    relationship
                    between
                    image and text (language and vision), and call into question how language mediates experience, as
                    well
                    as
                    how
                    such mediation can be represented visually. “Soft Power. Hard Margins.” is a series of neoclassical,
                    partially
                    gilded cast resin frames, each internally illuminated and framing a “canonical” artwork obscured by
                    a
                    sheet
                    of
                    frosted Plexiglas. Inspired by Adrian Piper’s assertion that “the right to freedom of expression is
                    a
                    permission, granted by the state, to engage in certain activities,” Morgan etched the “permission”
                    granted
                    by
                    each work into its face in her signature, typographically fragmented style. Installed in salon-style
                    clusters,
                    the works vary between three set sizes, a strategy alluding to their referents’ likelihood of
                    recognition by
                    the
                    viewer while simultaneously highlighting that “the viewer” is ideologically constructed.</div><br>

                <div class="body">In a moment of renewed attempts to deconstruct or expand existing canons as well as
                    reactionary
                    undertakings to defend them, “Soft Power. Hard Margins.” approaches its sources with neither
                    condemnation or
                    valorization. Instead, the inherently unstable relationships between the elements of each work
                    (size,
                    frame,
                    fragmented text, and partially-obscured image) complicates their legibility and requires the
                    viewer—whatever the
                    particularities of their identity and history—to contend with the ambiguous nature of artistic
                    legacy
                    and
                    “greatness,” authorship, and cultural inheritance. Furthermore, by undermining the power relations
                    that
                    legitimize interpretation, “Soft Power. Hard Margins.” elegantly limns the gaps between
                    presentation,
                    representation, and endorsement and materializes, as Piper added, that “not everything that is
                    permitted
                    is
                    required, nor can everything that is permitted be justified.”
